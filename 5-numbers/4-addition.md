# Prompt

A thorough REPL guide: https://repl.it/F6Gs/6

Implement a function that adds two numbers. But without using `+` or any other built-in arithmetic.

# Examples

```js
add(8, 0);     // 8
add(1, 1);     // 2
add(2, 2);     // 4
add(123, 456); // 579
add(19, 82);   // 101
```

# Solution

An optimized solution would make use of bit operations. There are a number of ways we might do this. The important thing to keep in mind is that if we have binary representations, addition works much the same way as with decimal representations. That is, we can add columns from left to right and carry over a `1` to the next column if the previous column adds to `10` or greater. In our case `10` is not "ten" though, it's "two". So if we have two ones in a column it will result in a `0` below it and a `1` carried over to the next column.

```
 1 <= carried
  10
+ 11
----
 101
```

Below is one possible solution. It uses XOR to compute the result without taking "carries" into account (let's call this value "uncarried"). Then it uses AND to find these "carries"â€”by shifting those carries one bit left (let's call this "carries"), we can then repeat the process. This time we XOR our "uncarried" result with our "carries" to get a new uncarried result, then we AND our uncarried result with our carries and shift left to get our new carries. We continue this until the "carries" equal `0`.

## Iterative

```js
function add (a, b) {
  while (b !== 0) {
    const uncarried = a ^ b;
    const carries = (a & b) << 1;
    a = uncarried;
    b = carries;
    // ^^ reseting `a` and `b` like this will ensure we continue XOR and AND ing the new values for the next cycle of the loop
  }
  return a;
}
```

## Recursive

```js
//Recursive Solution!
const add = (a, b) => {
  // Base case is that there is no more uncarried value.
  if (b === 0) return a;
  // Grab the raw bit addition through XOR
  const carried = a ^ b;
  // Check to see if there are any 'collisions' aka carry overs
  const uncarried = (a & b) << 1;
  // Call add again with new values
  return add(carried, uncarried);
}

//Recursive Solution Going to Prom
const promAdd = (a, b) => b === 0 ? a : promAdd(a ^ b, (a & b) << 1);
```
